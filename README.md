# Testing
Here is your task
Part 1:

You are joining an ongoing project, replacing a front-end developer who unexpectedly became long-term ill while developing the “create account” page for a new mobile application. To enter this role, you need to get familiar with the previously written code, for which you have been informed that some of the written functions already have related unit tests. You decide that a good approach is to initially run these tests, but after running them you realize that some of them fail. This concludes that one, or several, functions don’t work as intended. Your first task is therefore to edit the code to ensure that the functions work as they should. 

Note: The tests are correct, the error are caused by bugs in the main file. So, it is only the main.py that should be modified, not the testrunner file. 

Part 2:

After successfully running the implemented tests you notice two recently added functions. The front-end developer has created a draft of unit tests for these, in the file testrunner.py, but have left them uncompleted.
